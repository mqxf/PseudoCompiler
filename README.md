# PseudoCompiler
This program compiles Pseudocode to Java. It is written in Java and is still lacking features, as I am updating it regularly.  I might add a GUI and other features later.

If you want you can download the source code and change the inCode variable to change the code you want to compile. The inCode variable is currently showing every feature that I have coded in.

#Execution
If you have modified the inCode variable, you need to recompile the code, soon I will change that so that you only have to run the program (aka making user input for pseudocode input). If you did change it, compile the code with any java compiler.

To run the code, create a folder where your code will be, then place me/Maxim/Compiler/Main.class into that folder (include the me, Maxim and Compiler folders), then use a command line to go into that folder, and run "java me/Maxim/Compiler/Main"
