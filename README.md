# PseudoCompiler
This program compiles Pseudocode to Java. It is written in Java and is still lacking features, as I am updating it regularly.  I might add a GUI (or better text editor in console) and other features later.

You can look though the source code or if you want to use it download the out/ folder.

# Execution
To run the code, create a folder where your code will be, then place me/Maxim/Compiler/Main.class into that folder (include the me, Maxim and Compiler folders), then use a command line to go into that folder, and run "java me/Maxim/Compiler/Main"

# Usage
Currently I have not made a IDE/Text editor for this so the input is a bit janky. The instructions are displayed upon running the program, but you cannot go back and edit previous lines, I will add that feature later. For now enjoy messing around with this!
